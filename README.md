# ANA 515 Assignment 3: Getting and Cleaning Data

This repository contains the code and outputs for the ANA 515 Assignment 3, which involves getting and cleaning data from NOAA's Storm Events Database.

## Description

The goal of this assignment is to:
1. Download and read the storm events data.
2. Clean and transform the data by selecting specific columns, arranging, filtering, and modifying the data as required.
3. Merge the cleaned data with additional state information.
4. Create a plot that visualizes the number of storm events per state and compares it with the land area of each state.

## Instructions for Running the Code

1. Download the `StormEvents_details-ftp_v1.0_d2000_c20220425.csv` file and place it in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the R script `assignment3.R` in RStudio or any R environment.
3. The script will generate a plot and save it as `storm_events_vs_land_area.png`.
